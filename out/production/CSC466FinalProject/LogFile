Did Silhouette Score function and generated synthetic data set on Monday 6/2/25, took about 4 hours.
Did OneHotEncoder on Wednesday 6/4/25, to work with another data set (we scrapped that idea) took about 2.5 hours.
Justin and I worked on the report which took us about 40 minutes.

Did the KMeans Clustering code along with the point and cluster class, Monday 6/2/25 took about 3 hours to do.
Wrote the K hyperparamter tuning code to find the best k 6/5/25 took about 30 minutes, and did the some of the K clustering slides as well, on the same day 30 minutes.

Did all of my work on 6/5/25. 
Read in and processed both of our data files in the Matrix Class, and put them into Data Matrix Objects. Applied One Hot Encoding and Standardization methods on data read in. 
Used the Data Matrix Objects to run the K Means Clustering Algorithm. Attempted to created the visual for K Means Clustering. 
Took About 5 Hours to write all code.

5/23: Created GitHub and base files (~20 min)
5/25: Wrote all DBSCAN code and all Processing code (normalization, stdev, mean, etc) (~5 hrs)
6/5: Fixed bug in normalize, added functions to DBSCAN and KMeansClustering to print out data in csv format, wrote code for and performed hyperparameter tuning for DBSCAN and KMeansClustering, graphed best clusters for each, created slide show, did all slides for DBSCAN and Hyperparameter tuning (~4 hours)
