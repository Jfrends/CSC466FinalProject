What we want to do, compare the two algorithms below: 
●	DBScan 
●	K Means Clustering 
Steps: 
1)	Import the data set 
2)	Standardize the features 
3)	Run a one hot encoder on the categorical variables 

First, were gonna write the code for DBScan and K Means Clustering. Then we are going to run the algorithms of DBScan and K Means Clustering on the Data Set.



Files + Break Down of Tasks Among Group: 
●	General Processing File: 
→ one hot encoding: Collin 
→ standardization: Josh  
→ reading in the data from the file ~  Tara 

●	DBScan Algorithm File ~  Josh & Collin 

●	K Means Clustering Algorithm File ~  Tara & Justin
